## What did you do this past week?

I spent most of the week studying for the final test in this class. We covered a lot of material since the first exam, and some very dense topics during this week. I knew the only way I could receive an A in this class was to get a perfect score on the exam. Seeing as how I got a 120/200 on the first exam, things weren’t looking too good. But, I spent a lot of my time studying, and thinking about what twists on class material might show up on the exam. These exercises paid off big time, as I passed all the HackerRank tests on the exam.

## What's in your way

School is very close to over. I am finished with this course, and as I said above, the exam went very well. I don’t have any finals to worry about, but I still have to finish my Cyberphysical systems final project and report over the weekend. It is very difficult to motivate myself to continue to do school work, as the end is so near.

## What will you do next week?

Next week, I will be giving a live demo of my Cyberphysical systems project on Monday afternoon. After that, I will be finished with my spring semester. But of course, the grind never stops. I begin my internship at SailPoint on May 21st, and I plan to take a crash course on Angular before I start the job. In addition to that, I am enrolled in a university extension course for Texas government. Although this is a self-paced course that isn’t due until July, I figure I should try to knock out as much as I can, so I can focus on my internship. 

## What's my experience of the class?

I really enjoyed the class. I think that my only recurring complaint is that tests are not a very accurate representation of what I learned about C++ behavior. The tests can become more about how well you can code and debug under pressure, and some people just don’t operate that way. 

## What's my pick-of-the-week or tip-of-the-week?

My tip-of-the-week is a two-parter. First, if you don’t have a group of people in your courses that you can study with, then find some. I am typically a very diligent student, but when exam time comes, I find it hard to sit down and actually study on my own. This time around, I had a group of friends to study with, and it helped immensely. Second, if you are stuck during an exam question in this course, ASK QUESTIONS. This can be super helpful. Even if they cannot give you the answer, you might be able to explain your code to them, and in doing so you might realize where you went wrong.
